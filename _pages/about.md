<p>
    My name is Casey Mullineaux and I have a passion for cyber security, cloud computing and system automation. With
    over 10 years of cloud solution architecture and consulting experience, I excel at combining various technologies
    to design solutions to complex business problems.
</p>
<p>
    With a strong personal interest in automation combined with a focus on Microsoft Azure, the field of DevSecOps
    allows me to focus on cyber security while still find new and creative ways to join technologies together, and
    create something that is bigger than the sum of their parts.
</p>
<p>
    As a strong believer in the philosophy that if you’re not learning something new, then you’re getting left behind;
    I am a life time learner that is always seeking self-improvement, and ways to distribute my knowledge to my peers
    and the technical community.
